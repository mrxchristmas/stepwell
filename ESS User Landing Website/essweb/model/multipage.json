Zeolite belongs to a family of naturally occurring volcanic minerals with unique physical and chemical characteristics. Generally speaking, natural zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates. They consist of an open, three-dimensional cage-like structure and a vast network of open channels extending throughout. Loosely bound, positively charged atoms called cations are attached at the junctures of the negatively charged aluminosilicate lattice structure. Zeolite has a crystalline structure (similar to a honeycomb) consisting of a network of interconnected tunnels and cages. Zeolite has a high specific surface area; it's rigid framework eliminates shrinking and swelling. Perhaps the most commercially valuable and dynamic property of zeolite is its cation exchange capacity. The most common exchangeable cations found in zeolite molecules are ammonia, sodium, calcium, potassium, and magnesium, many which are desirable in numerous biological and industrial processes. The ability to release beneficial elements while capturing and binding other, often less desirable, materials makes zeolite an ideal media for selective adsorption of certain elements and compounds from soil, water and air."

In practice, the limiting factor to constant pressure operation is the minimum flow rate.  Over time, as filter fouls the flow rate will decay to maintain constant pressure by reducing pump VFD settings. When flow decay reaches a predetermined minimum flow rate, the pressure is allowed to rise to reach Pmax and pump stops at Pmax.
